# NSX-T-Reporting
A collection of python scripts which pulls out information from your NSX-T environment.
The majority of these scripts will output to a spreadsheet detailing the NSX-T environment.
These scripts primarily run against the Policy API, except for those components which use the manager API.
Some of these scripts use the Python SDK for NSX-T so you will need this installed, and can be found here:
